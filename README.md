### What is C++?
C++ is a powerful, high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983. It is an extension of the C programming language with additional features such as object-oriented programming (OOP) and generic programming. C++ is widely used in various domains, including system/application software, game development, embedded systems, and more.

### Features of C++:
1. **Object-Oriented:** C++ supports object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing for the creation of classes and objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   
2. **Portable:** C++ programs can be compiled on different platforms, making it a portable language.

3. **Efficient:** C++ provides low-level access to system resources and hardware, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.

4. **Rich Standard Library:** C++ comes with a rich standard library, known as the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides data structures (like vectors, lists, maps) and algorithms, making development faster and easier.

5. **Compatibility with C:** C++ is compatible with C, which means you can use C code in C++ programs, and most C++ compilers support C code.

### IDE
An IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's a kind of software program that helps programmers write code more efficiently.

Imagine it like a Pakistan army knife for programmers. It has all the tools they need in one place to write, edit, test and debug their code. This saves them time and effort compared to using separate tools for each task.


### Exercise No 01
**Question 1:** What is the key difference between a C++ compiler and an IDE?
